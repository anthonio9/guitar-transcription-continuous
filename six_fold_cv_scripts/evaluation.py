# TODO - set the model checkpoints at the top of the script (None -> assume latest to verify results first),
#        go through and evaluate each fold at the chosen checkpoint, print and average.
#        This will save a massive amount of time when collecting results.
#        Use guitar-transcription-with-inhibition/inference/evaluate_model.py as a starting point.
